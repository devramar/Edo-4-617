[[The Holy Pit]] doesn't feel like a pub. there's alcohol smell and crowd noise but the alfre deity stained glass window, old and large wooden doors really conflict.

Stella Oakley is gone, kidnapped. 

*Lucky describes her as:*
- Human
- last seen at The Holy Pit 1.5 weeks ago
- Absolute vanishment
- no relationships Lucky knows about

***Rhyste and Sarynetei got to see the CCTV at The Holy Pit***:
- White
- Tied back brown hair, quite long
- 5'5-5'8
- Muscular lass
- TATTOO: right of neck, strand of DNA
- GENETICALLY MODIFIED
- Left the building to the right

*Looked up Oatleys on the internet:*
- Within edo, Oakley is common enough to have a few last names.
- No Oakley exists that list a Stella
- Look into photos of those families:
	- Never referred to as Stella
	- Mystery girl that occasionally appears, mostly shows two other girls

Jareth contacted executive contact:
	- "Oh Stella? Isn't that Stiff's (Carl Oakley) kid?"
	- Bounty was put on (Carl Oakley's kid) Stella Oakley as she pissed off Edo Genetics

I Looked into Edo Genetics:
 - Not a big genetics company
 - owned by meritscale technologies
 - only have one location in an industrial district

- Edo Genetics surely can't store a person securely. I called Lyre and asked if she knows about it. Lyre said it's an awkard situation, it's a bit below RG Sec to store contract kidnapped people in a secure laboratory. 


ash needs to roll asap
