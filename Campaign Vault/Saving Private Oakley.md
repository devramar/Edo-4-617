Lyre gave us contact with [[Jemith Pesek (Lucky)|Jemith Pesek]]. He told us to meet him at [[The Holy Pit]] at our nearest convenience.

[[The Holy Pit]] doesn't feel like a pub. there's alcohol smell and crowd noise but the alfre deity stained glass window, old and large wooden doors really conflict. The place was once a church, an interesting juxtapose.

[[Stella Oakley]] is gone, kidnapped. 

*Lucky describes her as:*
- Human
- last seen at The Holy Pit 1.5 weeks ago
- Absolute vanishment
- no relationships Lucky knows about

***Rhyste and Sarynetei got to see the CCTV at The Holy Pit***:
- White
- Tied back brown hair, quite long
- 5'5-5'8
- Muscular lass
- TATTOO: right of neck, strand of DNA
- GENETICALLY MODIFIED
- Left the building to the right

*Looked up Oatleys on the internet:*
- Within edo, Oakley is common enough to have a few last names.
- No Oakley exists that list a Stella
- Look into photos of those families:
	- Never referred to as Stella
	- Mystery girl that occasionally appears, mostly shows two other girls

Jareth contacted executive contact:
	- "Oh Stella? Isn't that Stiff's (Carl Oakley) kid?"
	- Bounty was put on (Carl Oakley's kid) Stella Oakley as she pissed off Edo Genetics

I Looked into [[Edo Genetics]]:
 - Not a big genetics company
 - owned by meritscale technologies
 - only have one location in an industrial district
 - Edo Genetics surely can't store a person securely. I called Lyre and asked if she knows about it. Lyre said it's an awkard situation, it's a bit below RG Sec to store contract kidnapped people in a secure laboratory. 

EDO GENETICS:
 - all alfre scientists
 - new rotation of security is subsidiary of meritscale


Sneak strat:
 - 


Helicopter strategy:
 - pilot: 20k

getting into edo genetics
could be the security

in edo genetics with oakley after unaliving the dudes:
 - locician trust fuck with edo genetics
 - oakley finds shit of [[Linkis Atore]]
	 - ator was a military officer in the locician armed forces during the western war
	 - three holes in one of his ears. piercings for pro LNP nationalist earrings
		 - Looks like he's gone to work with Locician Trust and the Rift Labs
			 - Stella Oakley has a contact through lucky who might be able to help hunt the bitch
