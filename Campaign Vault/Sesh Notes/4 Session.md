## LNP Rift Labs

M.Steele went to look into the "LNP rift labs" but he didn't come back to tell em what's up. it was 2 years ago

fattock found:
> information from the holy pit. teleportation shit. poggers. lil rats on the track.

i texted lucky:
>"dickheads in white uniforms have been blabbing about some rift labs."

from the text, i intuited:
> some business sense shows these guys are real nasty associates in some way of the LNP. 

fattock looked into the lnp heirarchy:
> LNP is less powerful now. soldiers > officers > scientists > generals. these peeps are probs soldiers


lady ear is the ilkist goddess of justice.  (there's a stained glass mural of her)

5 soldiers. all pure white trenchcoat, orange armbands

1 soldier is wearing an orange poncho type beat. 

at the holy pit, lucky says "they're not the good sort and doesn't want em around, but he can't really do anything"

Jared places a tracker on the guy:
> "Excited for the new recruit (Jared)"
> Traffic cone is pessimistic loser
> They converse horribly about bad shit: "why no excision #2 (project excision is the genocide)"
> Tracker goes to normal places throughout Saturday.
> One says: "We're on route to the Rift Labs."
> Traffic Cone says "don't say that out loud or they'll proc your kill switch"
> Tracker goes to a bookstore called "Leatherbacks". 
> I know of Leatherbacks, not far from my complex in the adashi ward.
> Midday sunday, they're running the background check. They have a panic attack and find the bug.


From trying to kill the fools, we find:
> Kill switches are IED cyberkit addons to the brain stem
> Traffic-cone is a full natty with no cyber augs


Bonus moment - 50k

> The League interrogated traffic cone:
> no cyberkit cause of rejection
