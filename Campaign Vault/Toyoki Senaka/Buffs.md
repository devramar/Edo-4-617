***Silent Assassin (Perk)***
Your critical hit chance increases by +5 against surprised enemies.


***Get Off Me (Perk)***
Whenever you hit someone with a ranged attack, you may choose to attempt to knock them back. If your target fails a DC 12 Agility check, they are immediately pushed back 3 metres from the direction they were hit. If you use a melee attack, they automatically fail the check.


***Augmented Reality Targeting Interface (Augment)***
Once per long rest, you can apply a +5 modifier to your ranged attack roll.
