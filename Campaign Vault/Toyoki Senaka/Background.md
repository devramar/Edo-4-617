I'm Toyoki Senaka. I'm a male Alfre who's born and raised in the [[Adashi Ward]], the government sees me as a contract cleaner, but I'm secretly an assassin and spy for the [[Edo Community Fighters]]. 

I'll adapt to any job, but I'm known for spying, scouting, and killing quietly if the price is right. If not, I'll find my own way to compensate myself. I help those in need, if it's protesting, protecting, or killing. If people have to die for progress to be made, then progress will be made.


***Background***
I want to help cure corruption. The ones close to me have suffered greatly because of negligent use of power. hording power when those in need could use your help is what im trying to solve.

My parents were powerful enough to have their heads on contracts. when i was 15, they were assassinated. growing up they did nothing for me. I had to learn how to protect myself and the people i care for. I had to learn how to stay alive, how to shoot, how to kill. I was pretty good at it. The friends i kept weren't very good, but i fit right in.

I've been apart of a local "gang" since i was young. I say "gang" as it's only a gang by technicality. we're a few neighbourhoods wide community who provide protection for the communities cause the cops won't do shit. It gets more gang-like as you get to people like me and <chelsea / ash?>, who use our power for getting things done. i've killed some polititians around excena, stolen some important data, and proven myself among my friends as the one who does the dirty work. me and my homie/s <chelsea/ash> usually roll together and get things done. pretty recently we were approached by a new fixer who says he thinks we're good and can help us if we help him.

***Appearance***
Tall and skinny, casually rocks pretty baggy clothes with fancy sneakers etc. When on the job, i dress up clean in black tactical gear. I'm technologically savvy, so i've got augs / wearables on my arms to assist my spy shit. tattoos(?) and clan-related ear piercings i definitely have. My posture is pretty slick and laid back, i keep to myself but will definitely start talking if you vibe right and i want to.


***Personality***
I'm casual and lead life the same. I'm not proper or posh, I speak with my hands and i talk how i want. When things get serious i take things too lightly and that's hurt people in the past. I'm rash and kinda short tempered. I get frustrated and will take that out physically, i'll punch walls or kick the ground or punch my hands on each other.

***Ethnicity***
Mixed "Ratbit" Rabbit/Rat Alfre

***Vibe***
Has a pretty laid back vibe casually, but when pressure is needed, jojo intimidation aura seeps from my pores
