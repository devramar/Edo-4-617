***Silent Assassin***
Your critical hit chance increases by +5 against surprised enemies.


***Get Off Me***
Whenever you hit someone with a ranged attack, you may choose to attempt to knock them back. If your target fails a DC 12 Agility check, they are immediately pushed back 3 metres from the direction they were hit. If you use a melee attack, they automatically fail the check.
