## Quickdraw
It no longer takes an action to draw or holster weapons.

## Slick Movement
A sprint action doubles movement instead of only increasing it by half. However, you may only sprint once on your turn. You have a +3 bonus to Stealth checks that involve moving quickly.

## Silent Assassin
Your critical hit threshold decreases by 5 against surprised enemies.

## Second Chance
Whenever an individual hits you with a non-critical attack roll, you can choose to force them to miss. You can do this even after knowing the amount of damage you were to otherwise take. This can happen only once per Initiative roll.

## Augmented Reality Targeting Interface
Reactively +5 to a ranged attack roll once per long rest.
