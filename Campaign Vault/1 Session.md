### homie informant interrogation

caught some information about 

someone in meritscale is defecting. she's been trying to stir shit up from the inside. LIO ATORE (linkus atore) (vex's lore).

Alena Volkov. She's a human enigma. 40-50s. 
5-1-6 in Henrii at the Adashi Ward.

there's a bakery at 5-1-6.

She has some vendetta against meritscale with how much she's trying to sabotage shit 

Keat says there's probably a lot of defectors from meritscale and probably more people know about these people.

Armoured marked league van. Has the League star logo on it.

FATTOK. 


## Recon 5-1-6
Nothing of interest happens overnight

in the morning, a police car shows up. 

Alfress spoke to copper in the morning. I recognize her from recent vibage
- Lena Senafold. Probably someone from the apartment complex
- Alena Volkov probably went missing. Bakery owner is the apartment complex owner. 
- apartment lass says she was going off grid but has been gone for like 3 days now.

found a lead on alena:
 - safe behind the tv, led to a business card for jackson business associates 
 - another missing person has been revealed. michael steel (jarad's bro)
 - she left behind a card for the investor's function. 
 - investor's magazine titled "hoard" with a smug ass meritscale. 
     "Untouchable. The Meriscale approach to fighting slander"
     - She's written notes of MOs of writers, no proof but an idea of how meritscale is operating based off the notes volkov left behind.


## Volkov and the Investor's Function
Go to the function, go find Volkov cause she's probably there.

TOMORROW NIGHT IS THE FUNCTION. it is in the eastern wards.

Hino Fort in the Easern wards. Runs from 6pm-12am

Iafen says "a place for meritscale to flex his investments and shieieeet"

### At the Function

Jared sees Patty Kelth

i meet eyes with ken masuda
 - i gave him proxy number #1 

rayla spots volkov leaving the main hall and moved to the garden alone.
 - Across the hall, a Drakki someone has been watching her moves. 
 - Drakki looks very bizarre. Wearing medieval armour and massive war hammer 40k
 - toki and rayla follow volkov into the garden, "you have a phone call to make"
 - vex stalls the drakki for a brief moment
 - while calling, toki and rayla are acting like they're not intimidating.
 - Dane Firestrong is the drakki of the Merit Guard approaches and says some cringe shit. we engage in combat. 
 - we fought
