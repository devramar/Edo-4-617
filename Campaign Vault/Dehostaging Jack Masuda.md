[[RG Sec|RG Sec's]] [[Adrian Lyre]] has hired us for some corporate investigations.

[[Ken Masuda|Ken Masuda's]] [[Jack Masuda|son]] has been replaced with an envelope which says "we got your kid loser pay up". Masuda thinks he's about to find some fucked up shit with [[English Rain]] and believes this is going to expose a lot about [[William Scheffer]]; the head of English Rain.

After questioning Mayor Masuda, our recon lead us to [[The Apocalypse]], and the [[Lonely Trotter]]; places we believe Jack Masuda frequents.
- I went with Ray and Rhyste to The Apocalypse, Rhyste distracted guards while myself and Ray snuck into the security room, after disposing of the guard, we found footage of Scheffer furiously calling somewhere saying "Clear the space out of the office to make room for our special gues. Employees should be left alone, terminate everyone"
- The rest of the gang went to the Lonely Trotter, where they found out Cheffer carrying a drugged Jack Masuda into a car. 

((Alex's character)) recon'd where Jack Masuda was being held; hidden in plain sight at [[English Rain Holding]]. Lyre gave us the resources we needed to enter as maintenance crew. Once inside, we found that Scheffer was hunkered down in the ER Holding offices with bodyguards protecting him. After we incapacitated him, we got Jack, and ran to a second getaway car sourced by Lyre. 
- On the way down, he suggests (unofficially) that English Rain are supplying terrorist orgs with plastic explosives
