The Adashi ward is a core ward for the [[Edo Community Fighters|ECF]]. Most members live here, including myself. It's a quaint enough ward focused around a central mall / apartment complex / office space hybrid few blocks of a city connected by train to the rest of [[Edo]]. The rest of the ward consists of some traditional neighbourhoods, mostly owned by rich and old families who bought property long ago and some more industralised larger scale housing. Most students live in the Adashi College Housing Complexes (ACHC), but because housing here is so cheap and the Adashi college lifestyle isn't that bad, most young adults live in the Any to Rent buildings the college manages. [[My Roommates]] and I live in the AR-ashi building; an Any to Renter. Other Any to Renters are AR-eshi and AR-ushi (AR = Any Renter). The ECF members who don't live here probably live in the SOD-ashi, SOD-eshi or SOD-ushi (SOD = Student Only Designated). 

I wouldn't be surprised if most government officials now of our presence in the rental buildings, but the college is quite strict on providing any information to police or anyone without official documents / warrants, so it's quite a safe place to stay.
