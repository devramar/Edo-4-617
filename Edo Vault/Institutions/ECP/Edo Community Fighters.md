The Edo Community Fighters (ECF) are a small (no more than 10) radical offshoot of the [[Edo Community Patrol|ECP]]. Their main focus is to solve problems through prescriptive action, something the ECP will never do. The ECP's focus is on defending the streets through C.A.R.E, while the ECF's focus is on defense through action. 

 - "Helping the community by fixing the problems we face."
 
 - Does actual gang shit, will attempt to "solve problems" that may occur in or around the wards through any means necessary. usually this means convincing politicians by threatening things or merely having private conversations. Has lead to a few leading actions that may not have needed to occur from young adolescents craving to prove themselves. 
 
 - The ECF was formed by a few radical ECP members who saw the terrible actions happening upon their community, who saw the potential that a bit of return fire could cause to the gang wars, and acted by any means necessary to protect the people who call these neighborhoods home.
