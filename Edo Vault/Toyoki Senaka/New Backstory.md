# Family
Toyoki Senaka comes from a highly educated middle-class family. My family never had to worry about money necessarily which allowed my siblings and I to focus on having fun and engaging lives in which we all chose science and engineering like our mom at [[Adashi University]].

Although my big brother was an accident, it brought in a perspective to my parent's lives of having a family, thus bringing in myself and my younger brother. 

## Minera Senaka
My mom, as confident as she is smart. She's lived a challenging life going back and forth on providing crucial assistance on other people's projects, never really forming her own 'identity' within the [[Adashi University]] scholars. She has her own thesis project, but after 15 years is still struggling to let other perspectives and people in to help her. She's can be really stubborn sometimes, haha

My mom is everything to me. She's helped me so much in my education, supported me with all of her heart and helped me solve critical problems with my most proud project, my [[Senaka Boots]]
