These are all patented privately made technology by myself and my friends and family. These are patented under my company (which doesn't do anything right now) Toki Tech. This technology explicitly doesn't exist anywhere except on my body or with the collaborators who made it.

We're like co-contributors to each patent of tech so they do still own the tech i didn't gank it as my own or anything like that. That'd be fucked up.

# On My Body

### AR Glasses
With help from my roommates, we've managed to create AR glasses. For me, allows me to implement a HUD to display a bunch of telemetry about my devices and certain things. I don't care about AR.

The glasses appearance can look like regular glasses, but when HUD elements are displayed, people can see the screen flipped on the glasses pretty clearly.

When in range of my backback, the glasses hook into the TokiOnTheRun network and allows for the Micro PC to communicate two small monitors in the HUD, allowing me to see certain things I may have hooked up. With the Arm Bands in keyboard/trackpad mode, I am able to interact with the Micro PC as a normal (but kinda slow) PC. 

When connected through a Display Stealers, I can see the monitor/s I've stolen when in TokiNet range. If I have more than two monitors in stealing range, I can choose which ones with the bands

The glasses on their own can last for about 4 hours, but I can plug them into my bag while moving with a small cable that runs up my neck and can be hidden by a hoodie.

### Arm Bands
On my bottom arms, I've got two 5-finger wide displays embedded in sleek black bands which are used for two things:

Trigger Mode:
The touch screens can display certain buttons / gesture-able triggers which allow my bottom arms to trigger certain code execution to happen (like bottom right interact with bottom left and vice versa). 
These are predefined actions that I have to "program in" at a PC in any of my TokiNets. 

PC Mode:
The touch screens can display two halves of a keyboard, in which I can use my top hands to type, which only is used for the Micro PC and AR glasses combo.
I can also use the PC mode bands as a bluetooth keyboard and mouse

Both screens can turn into a trackpad by a screen button on the top outside corner, although I usually reserve the right band for that as I am right handed.

I usually grab my bottom right hand with my bottom left and cross top arms to type (I invert the keyboards so there's no muscle memory change to typing! left to right it's yuiopqwert)


# My Backpack

My backpack I've had custom created and modified with help from my roommates and other ECP members, 

### Power my Tech
At the base of my bag is a quick-release module for a battery, which has about 6 hours of active use right now, but it depends on what i plug into it of course. The module allows me to replace the battery with one of 2 spares i have lying around. There's a small 2 minute battery built into the bag itself which allows me to keep devices powered while I'm running around


### Private BagWifi
The private "TokiOnTheRun" wifi service is a small module at the top right corner of my bag which allows for short range fast comms with nearby devices and throughout the bag. It's at the top of my bag as there's a half-meter long antennae which can be either manually extended or remotely extended by a servo. 

### Data Server
Hidden in the right wall of my bag is a micro data server which can hold 1TB of data. It's connected to the bag's private wifi network, so I can scan and rip data in the field, and place it directly into my bag or get videos from my devices and have them save to there. 

### Micro PC
Hidden in the left wall of my bag is a micro PC, which is so tiny and underpowered that I basically only can execute certain scripts I make and allows for communication with my devices while running around.

#### Display Stealers
I have 2 Display Stealers in my backpack's small pocket, with a bunch more lying around at home / in my van. These low-profile devices hook around display cables, and can "see" the data transmissions from the cable to the monitor, allowing me to see any PC monitor I can physically wrap the display stealer around.

# My Boots
These are modified [[Senaka Boots]] which allow me to hover and glide. The modifications are:
- Instead of having internal batteries within the boots, I've cut some weight by having a power connection requirement for both of them. Each shoe has one cable input, connected typically to my backpack, which uses about an hour of battery use per minute on. 


# Viruses and Devices
Here's a list of all the viruses I've created in which I can use within the game:

#### Logical Stealer
If I can infect a PC, I can steal monitor control, functioning as a Display Stealer without the physical device.

#### Data Uploader
When in range of a TokiNet, this USB device can silently scan folder entries and allow me to select certain data I want to steal remotely and securely using either my Micro PC and data server in my bag, or the PC in my van, or any device I can install the viewer software on really.


### Rat-Net Boosters
A small rat like device i can place and control using HUD and bands which extends the range of the TokiNet in the case that I need extended access to something.
